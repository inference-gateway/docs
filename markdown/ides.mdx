# Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Inference Gateway is fully OpenAI-compatible, allowing you to configure it with your favorite IDEs and extensions using standard OpenAI integration settings. The following sections provide instructions for configuring popular IDEs and extensions.

## VSCode

[Continue.dev](https://continue.dev) is a VSCode extension that supports OpenAI-compatible APIs. You can configure it to use Inference Gateway as follows:

1. Install the Continue.dev extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=continue-dev.continuedev).

2. Open the Continue.dev configuration file by running the `Continue: Open Configuration` command in VSCode.

3. Add a new model configuration with the Inference Gateway endpoint:

```json
"models": [
  {
    "title": "Inference Gateway",
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "your-model-name", // e.g., groq/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
    "apiBase": "http://localhost:8080/v1",
    "apiKey": "your-api-key",
    "useLegacyCompletionsEndpoint": false
  }
]
```

4. Save the configuration file and restart VSCode.

## Cursor

[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) is an AI-first code editor that supports OpenAI-compatible APIs. To configure Cursor to use Inference Gateway:

1. Open Cursor and go to **Settings** by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom left corner or using the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+,` (Mac) or `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux).

2. In the settings sidebar, select **AI**.

3. Scroll down to find the **Custom Endpoint** section.

4. Enable the **Use Custom Endpoint** toggle.

5. Configure the following settings:
   - **API Endpoint**: Enter your Inference Gateway URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/v1`)
   - **API Key**: Enter your Inference Gateway API key
   - **Model**: Enter the model name you want to use (e.g., `groq/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`)

6. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

Now Cursor will use your Inference Gateway for all AI operations, including code completion, chat, and other AI-powered features.
